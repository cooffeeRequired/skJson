## ❓ What can SkJson do?

* create JSON from string and other sources, for example from various Bukkit objects such as `Location, Player, Entitiy, Inventory, and many more`
* it can also work with `.json` files, in the future it will also be able to work with `.jsonc` -> which are files that can contain comments.
* it can also report HTTP requests and send http responses json encoded.
* it can also work with `FileWatchers` which is an advantage when for example you have a file that changes the server like for example `ops.json` -> a file that contains Server Operators
  * at this point SkJson can read this file and can update its cache with each change
* `SkJson` works with **`MemoryCache`** so it is very fast to write and read around `100-1000 us`
* `SkJson` allows to create `VirtualCachedJson` which is a type of storage something like `Script` variables, it serves as a dynamic storage for various things.
* `SkJson` also supports NBT thanks to **NBT-API**, so you won't lose NBT from given input when serializing.
* `SKJson` in the last line can serialize and deserialize almost everything you know in MC.

## 🌀 Get started
* Paste `Skjson.jar` into the `<server>/plugins` folder
* * set what we need in `plugins/SkJson/config.yml`

## 📖 Wiki
* Let's learn about what SkJson is for and how to use it properly. 
* In general, we could say that SkJson is very multifunctional. It contains some web request functionalities, and also handles strings that work with files. 
* Additionally, it allows us to use a so-called cache. 
* We will delve further into all these aspects as we learn more
